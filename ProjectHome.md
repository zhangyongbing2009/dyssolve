Dynamic System Solver – DYSSOLVE (pronounced as “dissolve”) is an open-source software to solve structural dynamics problems. It is written in platform-independent, widely used Matlab programming language. A compiled version is available which does not require Matlab license. DYSSOLVE is designed to fill the need for a lightweight, classroom instruction and learning tool. Various problems which can be solved include Single and multi-degree of freedom spring-mass-damper systems, Dynamic Analysis of Frame Structures, Rizt-beam, Spring-connected pendulum, String vibration, Visualization of beam and plate modes. The software architecture is such that more modules can be easily integrated or developed.
